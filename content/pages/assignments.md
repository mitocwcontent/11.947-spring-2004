Overview of the Client and Project Focus
----------------------------------------

### Viet-AID & Fields Corner

Established in 1995, Viet-AID is the first and only grassroots CDC founded and operated by Vietnamese refugees and immigrants in the U.S. Located in the Fields Corner neighborhood of Dorchester, Viet-AID seeks to build a strong Vietnamese American community in Boston and a vibrant Fields Corner neighborhood. This mission is anchored by four basic goals:

1.  to engage Vietnamese residents in community organizing efforts,
    
2.  to promote economic development and self sufficiency,
    
3.  to build affordable housing for residents, and
    
4.  to foster youth leadership.
    

Fields Corner is one of the most diverse and lowest-income neighborhoods in Boston as well as a diverse and vibrant commercial district. At 1.2 square miles, Fields Corner is home to 20,000 residents and 60 plus Vietnamese businesses, among others. The area is accessible by subway and bus. Serious environmental pollution is a result of the many auto-related uses in Fields Corner, as well as other instigators of pollution. Disinvestment and lack of sound economic infrastructure as well as regular city services have contributed to the economic blight of the area.

Viet-AID's goal for this project is to develop a comprehensive strategic plan that will:

1.  identify strategies for new business start-up and expansion to increase employment opportunities and create assets and wealth;
    
2.  identify strategies to work with the auto-related businesses in the area that result in positive environmental and economic impacts; and,
    
3.  build capacity of Vietnamese entrepreneurs to incorporate environmentally and economically sound business practices.
    

### JPNDC & Jackson Square

The Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC) was founded in 1977 to work closely with neighborhood residents, organizations and businesses committed to planning and carrying out community development projects to benefit low-income residents of Jamaica Plain. Together they work to maintain diversity and revitalize the Jamaica Plain neighborhood through a comprehensive strategy for community empowerment, economic development, and affordable housing. JPNDC has built or renovated 300 units of housing and created 600 jobs. More than 500 JPNDC members play an active role in organizing neighborhood festivals, cleanups and other activities. Their approach is rooted in the belief that the active involvement of community members is absolutely critical. Resident input and control is built through participatory planning processes, the integration of community organizing into projects, and leadership development.

Jackson Square, the study area, has undergone an intensive, community-centered planning process over the last four years. The Jackson Square Coordinating Group (JCG) involves over 30 community-based organizations and was appointed by Mayor Menino in 1999 to develop priorities around vacant and under-utilized land in Jackson Square.

JPNDC's goals for this project include gaining insights and strategies for the Jackson Square site that will:

1.  provide well-paid employment opportunities for area residents;
    
2.  develop affordable housing that meets the needs of area residents;
    
3.  empower community members to direct and inform the development process for land in their neighborhood;
    
4.  restore contaminated spaces to vital use;
    
5.  ensure that redeveloped land will not become a Brownfield of tomorrow;
    
6.  address issues of mobility, community health, energy production, and overall environmental impact through responsible approaches to design, material and system choice, and construction; and
    
7.  build community capacity for and understanding of sustainable development.
